•	
•	9.
•	What challenges are you looking for in a position?
•	“I understand that challenges are part and parcel of the job requirement that I am aiming for. I am actually looking for jobs that would challenge me on a professional basis, so that I can enhance my skills/abilities in order to add more value to the product or service that the company is offering to its clients. “
•	10.
•	Are you applying for other jobs?
•	 If you have not applied for other jobs, be honest and say it is the start of your job search, or you are only looking for really special opportunities – and go on to say why you feel so suited to this one. Never make up interest from other labs or companies – especially if you work in a small field – as the interviewer might know their peers there and find out the truth. As with relationships, don’t make yourself sound overly available, by stating you have applied for a plethora of jobs. If you do have a serious offer from another company that you will need to decide on imminently, mention it now – so this interviewer knows the position you are in.
•	Overall, the best bet is to to say that you have had interest from other companies or organisations in the sector without mentioning names, but that this is the job that has really caught your eye – and go on to explain why and why it is such a good fit with you. And just like dating, even if you are the most coveted candidate, don’t behave as if you are doing them a favour by spending your time in their company.

Systems Analyst
-	A person who analyzes a complex process or operation in order to improve its efficiency, especially by applying a computer system.
Tell me about yourself.
•	I am a former OFW from Saudi Arabia.  I worked with teams in a multicultural environment.  This is where I really developed my communication skills and learned a lot from my chosen field.  Right now my skills and experience make me a great candidate for a position on your team, and I hope to demonstrate that today.
What are your strengths?
•	My greatest strengths include my ability to focus, maintain quality and accuracy, a good listener and I’m very customer service oriented.  I treat everyone as a customer, my bosses and co-workers.  For example, at my last job everytime there is a request from bosses or co-workers, technical support or reports, I will finish the request quickly and accurately.
What are your weaknesses?
•	I would say that my biggest weakness is that I don’t like to miss deadlines, so sometimes I get impatient with colleagues that lag with their piece of the project.  Well,  I have to learn that different people are motivated by different things.  But I have been improving it over time, and it has really paid off, and made me a better employee.
Tell me about your proudest achievement.
•	One thing I liked about my last job was that it allowed me to develop my leadership skills.  For example, I was put in charge of a project (a customized CRM) where I had to coordinate or collaborate with different departments, sales and marketing, logistics and finance.  I held all the responsibility for getting this project completed on time.  I had to make sure that all the people involve is doing their tasks on time.  I completed the project on schedule and it was a success.
Tell me about a time where you had to deal with conflict on the job.

Why should we hire you?
•	I think I have demonstrated that I have the focused work habits, problem solving abilities, and people skills that it will take to do a great work for you and succeed if I join your team.  I would also say that I am unique, different, and hopefully the best candidate for this position based on my extensive experience in handling business challenges exactly like those that you face every day.  I am a dedicated and loyal, hard worker and I’ll do what it takes to make your projects a success in every way.

Why have you had so many jobs in such a short period of time?
I have taken advantage of different opportunities to gain new skills and experiences. I have been able to easily fit into different organizations and make a solid contribution. 

I can see why you ask that question, and I have to say that I was able to pursue different opportunities that aligned with my career goals because I am a reliable, quick learner with the people skills needed to “fit in” and be effective in different environments. I have had opportunities to see how several different businesses do things, and that is really why I am here today. I have a fairly clear understanding of how this company operates, and I like it, and I do want to be here a long time so that I can contribute to everyone’s success – including my own.




What was the last project you headed up, and what was its outcome?

Can you describe a time when your work was criticized?

What is your personal mission statement?
•	I am dedicated to enhancing customer productivity by providing superior technical support.  I focus on our customers by delivering high-value support services and fostering teamwork and continuous improvement in everything I do.

What is your greatest failure, and what did you learn from it?
•	Sure.  Like everyone, I get discouraged from time to time.  I get discouraged mostly when unresolved problems linger for too long, or when tasks start to rack up in my “to do” list.  I like to resolve problems as soon as I can – so that I can focus on moving forward.  Occasionally I have let items linger on my list, but everyday I really focus on getting everything done so I can start fresh with a clean slate every week.

Give me an example of a time you did something wrong.  How did you handle it?

















Sell me this pencil.
•	CEO: Do me a favor, sell me this pen. (reaches across to hand me the pen)
•	Me: (I slowly roll the pen between my index and thumb fingers.) When was the last time you used a pen?
•	CEO: This morning.
•	Me: Do you remember what kind of pen that was?
•	CEO: No.
•	Me: Do you remember why you were using it to write?
•	CEO: Yes. Signing a few new customer contracts.
•	Me: Well I’d say that’s the best use for a pen (we have a subtle laugh).
•	Wouldn’t you say signing those new customer contracts is an important event for the business? (nods head) Then shouldn’t it be treated like one. What I mean by that is, here you are signing new customer contracts, an important and memorable event. All while using a very unmemorable pen.
•	We grew up, our entire lives, using cheap BIC pens because they get the job done for grocery lists and directions. But we never gave it much thought to learn what’s best for more important events.
•	This is the pen for more important events. This is the tool you use to get deals done. Think of it as a symbol for taking your company to the next level. Because when you begin using the right tool, you are in a more productive state of mind, and you begin to sign more new customer contracts.
•	Actually. You know what? Just this week I shipped ten new boxes of these pens to Elon Musk’s office.
•	Unfortunately, this is my last pen today (reach across to hand pen back to CEO). So, I suggest you get this one. Try it out. If you’re not happy with it, I will personally come back next week to pick it up. And it won’t cost you a dime.
•	What do you say?
•	CEO: (picks jaw up off floor)  Yes.
An example can be as simple as this: While working on a series of graphics for a feature on a blockbuster movie premiere in the school paper, my editors became much pickier than usual on my submissions. They repeatedly would suggest that I change or redo colors, rearrange items, and keep pushing the creative qualities in my pieces. I took their feedback to heart and really poured all of my energy and inspiration into the assignments, and in the end, we came out with an amazing feature in the paper that was highly praised by staff and readers alike.
